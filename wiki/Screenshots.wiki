== Scatterplot (Lattice graphics) ==
{{{
## Scatterplot (Lattice graphics).
## Labels are taken from rownames of data.
## Right-click on the plot to identify points,
## or switch to Identify mode and left-click.
playwith(xyplot(Income ~ log(Population / Area),
   data = data.frame(state.x77), groups = state.region,
   type = c("p", "smooth"), span = 1, auto.key = TRUE,
   xlab = "Population density, 1974 (log scale)",
   ylab = "Income per capita, 1974"))
}}}

Right-clicking on a point brings up a context menu with the values of covariates; however, if you right-click elsewhere on the plot, a general menu comes up:

== Scatterplot (base graphics) ==
{{{
## Scatterplot (base graphics); similar.
urbAss <- USArrests[,c("UrbanPop", "Assault")]
playwith(plot(urbAss, panel.first = lines(lowess(urbAss)),
   col = "blue", main = "Assault vs urbanisation",
   xlab = "Percent urban population, 1973",
   ylab = "Assault arrests per 100k, 1973"))

== Time series plot (Lattice) ==
{{{
## Time series plot (Lattice).
## Date-time range can be entered directly in "time mode"
## (supports numeric, Date, POSIXct, yearmon and yearqtr).
## Click and drag to zoom in, holding Shift to constrain;
## or use the scrollbar to move along the x-axis.
library(zoo)
playwith(xyplot(sunspots ~ yearmon(time(sunspots)),
                xlim = c(1900, 1930), type = "l"),
         time.mode = TRUE)
}}}

== Time series plot (base graphics) ==
{{{
## Time series plot (base graphics); similar.
## Custom labels are passed directly to playwith.
## Note that label style can be set from a menu item.
tt <- time(treering)
treeyears <- paste(abs(tt) + (tt <= 0),
                  ifelse(tt > 0, "CE", "BCE"))
playwith(plot(treering, xlim = c(1000, 1300)),
   labels = treeyears, time.mode = TRUE)
}}}

== Multi-panel Lattice plot ==
{{{
## Multi-panel Lattice plot.
## Need subscripts = TRUE to correctly identify points.
## Scales are "same" so zooming applies to all panels.
Depth <- equal.count(quakes$depth, number = 3, overlap = 0.1)
playwith(xyplot(lat ~ long | Depth, data = quakes,
      subscripts = TRUE, aspect = "iso", pch = ".", cex = 2),
   labels = paste("mag", quakes$mag))
}}}
