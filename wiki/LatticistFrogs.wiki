#summary Demonstration of Latticist applied to 'frogs' dataset
#labels Featured

_This example includes the use of marginal.plot, groups, splom, spatial point data, and the z variable for a 3D point-cloud._

The `frogs` dataset is available in the *DAAG* package. The data are on the distribution of the Southern Corroboree frog, which occurs in the Snowy Mountains area of New South Wales, Australia.

The initial display shows marginal distributions of all variables in the data frame. The x axis labels give a summary of the range of each variable. Begin by clicking "choose variables" and reducing the number of variables shown:

Now, with a more manageable number of variables, set the "groups" to `pres.abs`, which indicates whether frogs were present (1) or absent (0) at each location.

This reveals relationships with distance, number of sites, and temperature (maybe the frogs find it too cold below 2 degrees C).

Click the "splom" button in the Hypervariate section to convert the display to a scatter-plot matrix. The groups are not very helpful here, but there are obvious correlations between altitude, temperature and, to a lesser degree, rainfall.

To view the spatial distribution of observations, set the x and y variables to "easting" and "northing":

The lines here come from a _loess_ smoother, which treats the y variable as a function of the x variable; that is not appropriate in this case, so remove them by clicking the "Lines" checkbox. Also set the "Aspect" option to "iso", because x and y are in the same units.

Set the z variable to "altitude". The 3D view can be rotated and zoomed.

From this view it appears that the frog populations are clustered on the slopes in distinct valleys. Only a few outlying sites in the higher land support populations.

Right-click on a point to see the values of all variables. (It is also possible to add a persistent label this way).
