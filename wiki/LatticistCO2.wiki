  * Plant, a unique identifier for each plant;
  * Type, a factor with levels Quebec / Mississippi, giving the origin of the plant;
  * Treatment, a factor with levels nonchilled / chilled;
  * conc, a numeric vector of ambient carbon dioxide concentrations (mL/L);
  * uptake, a numeric vector of carbon dioxide uptake rates (umol/m^2 sec).
